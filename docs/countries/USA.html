        <p class="blog">"My influences, Salvador Dali, Grant Wood, Francis Bacon and Henri Matisse. Their weird, wonderful art makes me see the world in a different light every single day. That is why I spend my days searching the street for potential art, people are my influences, life is my influence.
          I've been like this since I can remember, I never used to concentrate in any other lesson apart from art in elementary school. My family disapproved of me doing art, "You won't be able to get a job in Art, noone hires an artist, you're income will never support your life" but
          that never stopped me in undertaking a degree in fine art. I practiced different elements of art until I graduated from university, I never applied to any jobs after university because I didn't want someone telling me what to draw and by when. I wanted to be my own individual,
          that is why I spend my days drawing art and figuring out ways to sell and showcase my art in gallerys. To date I've held 15 showcases and I've been mentioned in the local newspapr for my unique way of drawing. That to me is success." </p>

          <p class="blog">""We are the sum of experiences that we encounter as we go through life. Day to day struggles and triumphs are experienced by all of the world's creatures. As human beings, when we encounter a challenge, we have freedom to choose how to react.
            Every decision that we make leads us down a different road. We will never come to exactly the same crossroads. Every decision that we make has significance. The tiniest choice that we make reverberates throughout the entire universe."
            After studying I became a freelance poet, I like to make people feel something through powerful, expressive words."</p>

            <p class="blog">"My parents always put pressure on education from a young age. I excelled in the majority of subjects and received a scholarship to study a joint maths and science degree. The scholarship was one of my most greatest achievements and I could finally repay my parents for their
              hard-work. It was until the second year of university when I realised my real passion in life. I started volunteering at a hospital to help patients recover from operations or just lend a hand to the over-worked staff, this was when I realised the passion and drive that doctors had to help and save humans.
              I dropped out of university to undertake a medical degree and I have now been a doctor for 3 years and I plan on volunteering in unprivileged countries." </p>

              <p class="blog">"I don't look your typical student do I... I am, but I also recognise that people judge at first glance. I graduated in Political Science, and I'm not concentrating on breaking down judgements made by the general public, it also enabled me to be who I am and to be judged on my mind not my looks.
                I left university with a degree and instead of following the typical paths of Political Science students, I took a gap year to figure out what exactly I wanted to do. I travelled across different continents to explore different political views and how the public have been affected by politics. I am now a campaign worker making a stand on what I believe in." </p>

                <p class="blog">"I'm a corporate lawyer, I put bad people away. That was my childhood dream, and I've made my dream my reality. I worked hard in university and I got what I wanted. I couldn't ask for a better job and I don't see myself in any other position. My job allows me to have an
                  alter ego and my personal life sees the real Simona" </p>

                  <p class="blog">"I studied Geography at university for 3 years as I was passionate about the enviroment and how humans are having a negative effect on it. However, I began to get too involved with the partying lifestyle that came along with attending university and I wanted to continue,
                    living while I'm young. I scratched a pass at university and since then I have been searching the USA for jobs that pay the bills. I take part in sideline volunteering jobs that allow me to keep in touch with my Geography passion. It is something I would like to go back into,
                    but right now I am 24 years old and there is alot of the world left for me to explore." </p>
