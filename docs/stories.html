      <p class="blog">"Haha, have you ever seen the film 'Tiny Furniture' about the graduate? I would loveit if my life resemble someone a bit more glamourous but the main character, that's me in a nutshell. Back at home, working a casual job in a restaurant around the corner, constantly pestered by my mother to get out and do something.
        Ah I'm the stereotype, but what can you do, Its not forever, I hope..Ha but really its not all that bad..I know lots of people who are in the same boat so at least there's that. I studied Accounting thinking it would leadmestraight into a job but the truth is I don't enjoy it too much. I wish I had studied art..maybe not the best for getting a job
        but at least I would be doing something I care about. I'm still young so anything is possible right? There's still time to change things..So yeah..you know I'm hopeful"</p>

        <p class="blog">""I studied Zoology at King's..I know it's a cliche' to say this but I loved animals ever since I was a kid. My parents bought me a little vets outfit and I remember I would practice my skills on my dog, listening to his chest with my stethoscope. So that's where it all started.
          When it came to uni I was in no doubt what I wanted to study. Okay so I'm not a vet but I could never really handle blood so it didn't seem like such a good idea for me..Zoology was a better fit. I want to go into conservation which is a really hard field to break into, everybody gets a masters these days
          so at the moment I'm doing a traineeship with the Wildlife Trust and after that I'd like to go overseas and do some real fieldwork. That's the dream!"</p>

          <p class="blog">"I grew up in Bromley just outside London. To be honest I would love to have made my parents proud but they never really believed in university. They would say to me 'what are you doing that far, why don't you just work like the rest of us? so now i feel that added pressure. I haven't found anything yet but I'm honestly scared I'll jump into
            any old thing just to get them off my back, but that's not what I want..you know it's not what I've worked so hard for. I'd like to go into charity work..like my community wasn't so bad but there's definitely a lack of support for young people..and I really would have loved someone to support me and tell me that I wasn't just making a huge mistake back when I
            applying. Yeah, so that's my plan, we'll see I guess"</p>

            <p class="blog">"I have just finished a postgrad and I am originally from France. I had never been to England before but for my degree I stayed close to home in Lyon and I just thought I really need to branch out, get out of my comfort zone, you know? And it has been a learning curve for me. London is fantastic, so many international students, so many things to do.
              I am doing some tutoring at the moment teaching french to A-level students. It is hard to get into the art world but I am trying hard. Originally I was planning to go back to France and my family call me and say 'but why you want to stay there?! it is like Paris but with bad food' and I say 'you know what? It really feels like home now'"" </p>

              <p class="blog">"I've been working for an law firm for a couple of months now..no three months! man that's flown by..honestly I feel so lucky. During final year of law it's how you imagine, it's intense, everyone's stressing out and I was just thinking there's no way I'll get offered a place with so many hard-working grads..but I was shocked! first place I applied,
                I couldn't believe it..my family are really proud, none of them went to uni so they just keep telling everyone they can 'our son just graduated!' but they just keep reminding me 'don't turn into one of those guys with dollar signs behind his eyes" ha </p>

                <p class="blog">"I studied languages at university for 4 years because I lived in France for a while as a kid and it just gave me a passion for speaking learning languages and speaking with people from all walks of life. In my third year we had to do a year abroad and I found that really tough. Everyone had said to me 'it was the best year of my life!' so when I was
                  out there, struggling at the university, finding it hard to make friends and spending nights in my room I skimmed through photos on fb of my coursemates and it got me really down..I stopped going to uni for a while, it was a real struggle..But then actually when I got back and term started in our final year, turns out all those people I thought were having a blast
                  found it really hard too. So to be honest I'm proud of how far I've come. You'll be surprised to hear I've now found a job abroad and I feel much more ready for it, I'm excited.."</p>
