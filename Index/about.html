  <div class="info"> "Grads of London began as a idea by two former graduates in the UK who took part in a coding project. The initial goal was to create an extensive catalogue of London's graduates."</div>
<br><br><br><br>
<div class="quote"> "We wanted to make these stories as realistic as possible to outline the different paths that students have took since graduation.
    We wanted empower students across the globe with these stories, so they know that everyone is unique and there is no 'right' path to take after university." </div>
