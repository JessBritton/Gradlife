    <p class="blog">"Haha, have you ever seen the film 'Tiny Furniture' about the graduate? I would loveit if my life resemble someone a bit more glamourous but the main character, that's me in a nutshell. Back at home, working a casual job in a restaurant around the corner, constantly pestered by my mother to get out and do something.
    Ah I'm the stereotype, but what can you do, Its not forever, I hope..Ha but really its not all that bad..I know lots of people who are in the same boat so at least there's that. I studied Accounting thinking it would leadmestraight into a job but the truth is I don't enjoy it too much. I wish I had studied art..maybe not the best for getting a job
    but at least I would be doing something I care about. I'm still young so anything is possible right? There's still time to change things..So yeah..you know I'm hopeful"

 <p class="blog">"I grew up in Bromley just outside London. To be honest I would love to have made my parents proud but they never really believed in university. They would say to me 'what are you doing that far, why don't you just work like the rest of us? so now i feel that added pressure. I haven't found anything yet but I'm honestly scared I'll jump into
       any old thing just to get them off my back, but that's not what I want..you know it's not what I've worked so hard for. I'd like to go into charity work..like my community wasn't so bad but there's definitely a lack of support for young people..and I really would have loved someone to support me and tell me that I wasn't just making a huge mistake back when I
       applying. Yeah, so that's my plan, we'll see I guess"</p>

<p class="blog">"I've been working for an law firm for a couple of months now..no three months! man that's flown by..honestly I feel so lucky. During final year of law it's how you imagine, it's intense, everyone's stressing out and I was just thinking there's no way I'll get offered a place with so many hard-working grads..but I was shocked! first place I applied,
      I couldn't believe it..my family are really proud, none of them went to uni so they just keep telling everyone they can 'our son just graduated!' but they just keep reminding me 'don't turn into one of those guys with dollar signs behind his eyes"</p>
