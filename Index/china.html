         <p class="blog">"Life in China is not much different from anywhere else in the world. The lifestyle of the local people in some way are influenced by western cultures. The shopping, entertainment and food in these big cities are world class. Western fast food restaurants like Starbucks, McDonald, Kentucky can easily be found in big cities and chinese cuisine is quite delicious. Other cuisines like Japanese, Korea are easily available. I chose
           to study in China because the universities are rich, colorful and fulfilling, with vibrant people all welcoming me with opportunities and events to get involved in. I wanted to embark on a new journey of study life and step out of my comfort zone. I wanted to be trained to be more independant, flexible and enjoy the unexpected whilst meeting new people and cultures. During university I studied biology, I chose to do this because it is all about studying life
           and living organisms. We're living organisms and we eat living organisms, so you could probably guess that it has something to tell us about what's going on all around – and inside – us. Currently, I have travelled back to my family home and I have yet to find a job, but China will always have a place in my heart." </p>

        <p class="blog">"I am half Japanese, half Canadian and I grew up in Tokyo, Japan. I am a year-4 student in the Faculty of Business Administration, specialising in brand management. I chose East China Normal university because I am pursuing a career in business, therefore it is crutial for me to understand how to conduct business properly on a global scale. I wanted to expose myself to a different culture to enhance my knowledge
          in international business. Due to taking a risk and studying aboard, I landed a job doing full-time sales at Google,Japan." </p>
