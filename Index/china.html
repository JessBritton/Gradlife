        <p class="blog">"I'm still in university, working towards becoming an Accountant. I've always been fascinated by numbers and I observe life with an logical and numerical eye. At the end of the day, money is what keeps the world moving and humans alive. Without digital numbers the best businesses in the world wouldn't be running, this includes healthcare providers.
          I want to be a part of the fast, demanding environment that accountants work in and I want to see how the world works. I'm aware that money is known as the root of all evil, but there's so much more to money than what people realise. I've grew up in an unprivileged community, where my neighbours, friends and family would commit crimes just to afford food for the evening.
          I want to make a difference, not many people in my community have had the opportunity like I have had with university, so I am making sure that try my best and make a difference for them. </p>

         <p class="blog">"Life in China is not much different from anywhere else in the world. The lifestyle of the local people in some way are influenced by western cultures. The shopping, entertainment and food in these big cities are world class. Western fast food restaurants like Starbucks, McDonald, Kentucky can easily be found in big cities and chinese cuisine is quite delicious. Other cuisines like Japanese, Korea are easily available. I chose
           to study in China because the universities are rich, colorful and fulfilling, with vibrant people all welcoming me with opportunities and events to get involved in. I wanted to embark on a new journey of study life and step out of my comfort zone. I wanted to be trained to be more independant, flexible and enjoy the unexpected whilst meeting new people and cultures. During university I studied biology, I chose to do this because it is all about studying life
           and living organisms. We're living organisms and we eat living organisms, so you could probably guess that it has something to tell us about what's going on all around – and inside – us. Currently, I have travelled back to my family home and I have yet to find a job, but China will always have a place in my heart." </p>

        <p class="blog">"I am half Japanese, half Canadian and I grew up in Tokyo, Japan. I am a year-4 student in the Faculty of Business Administration, specialising in brand management. I chose East China Normal university because I am pursuing a career in business, therefore it is crutial for me to understand how to conduct business properly on a global scale. I wanted to expose myself to a different culture to enhance my knowledge
          in international business. Due to taking a risk and studying aboard, I landed a job doing full-time sales at Google,Japan." </p>

       <p class="blog">"I went to uni to study digital technology. I graduated at the top of my class and everyone around me had high expectations for my future. <br>
         I quit my job earlier this year. I’m taking a little time to focus on myself after working from nine to six everyday. I often brought my work home with me and I was getting sick, and anxious, and I wasn’t sleeping well. But I could never accept my weaknesses. I’d see other people working harder than me, and I’d think: ‘If they can do it, why should I feel tired?’ Eventually I pushed myself so hard that I became depressed.
          One reason I couldn’t slow down is because my entire family is hard working and they had huge expectations of me. The importance of hard work has been passed down through the generations. There have been so many hard times. There’s been so much hunger. For so long we had to work all the time just to survive. Even though things are better now,
          that’s a difficult to psychology to escape. I’m starting to interview for new jobs. But I’m asking different questions. Money is the last thing I worry about, I’m much more interested in the schedule." </p>
