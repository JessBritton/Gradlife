        p class="blog">"My influences, Salvador Dali, Grant Wood, Francis Bacon and Henri Matisse. Their weird, wonderful art makes me see the world in a different light every single day. That is why I spend my days searching the street for potential art, people are my influences, life is my influence.
        I've been like this since I can remember, I never used to concentrate in any other lesson apart from art in elementary school. My family disapproved of me doing art, "You won't be able to get a job in Art, noone hires an artist, you're income will never support your life" but
      that never stopped me in undertaking a degree in fine art. I practiced different elements of art until I graduated from university, I never applied to any jobs after university because I didn't want someone telling me what to draw and by when. I wanted to be my own individual,
    that is why I spend my days drawing art and figuring out ways to sell and showcase my art in gallerys. To date I've held 15 showcases and I've been mentioned in the local newspapr for my unique way of drawing. That to me is success. </p>
